`JavaScript`

## Background Context

JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:

- Scripting (same as we did with Python)
- Web front-end

For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting. After, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.

### I learnt about

- Why JavaScript programming is amazing
- How to run a JavaScript script
- How to create variables and constants
- What are differences between `var`, `const` and `let`
- What are all the data types available in JavaScript
- How to use the `if`, `if ... else` statements
- How to use comments
- How to affect values to variables
- How to use `while` and `for` loops
- How to use `break` and `continue` statements
- What is a function and how do you use functions
- What does a function that does not use any `return` statement return
- Scope of variables
- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
- How to manipulate dictionary
- How to import a file
